Sick of an endlessly growing PATH?  Me too!

Envy does shell-independent environment variable management.


Envy attempts to avoid ambition.  It is designed as a narrow tool to
solve a specific and practical problem without going wildly overboard.
Its narrow scope includes:

* A mechanism is provided for setting and prepending environment
variables in a variety of flexible ways.  All modifications are
reversible.

* Standardized crontab wrapper.

* Optional .profile and .login setup.

  (Probably requires perl 5.004_05 but older version might work too.)

Here's what it looks like:

[joshua@grdevl137] ~% envy
   dailydb-dev                          imag-dbo-testdb
 x dev                                  imag-dev-2513
   dev-area-setup                       imag-dev-2519
   fame                                 imag-prod
   framemaker                           java
 x fvwm95-2.0.43a                       objstore
   gcc                                x openwin
   gems-1.9.1-dev                       printing
   gems-2.0-dev                         prod
   gems-2.0.alpha.14                    prod-new
   gems-dev                             research
   gems-intl-rpts                     x reuters
   gems-prod                            solaris
   imag-2519                            sunpro
   ...

'x' indicates that the environement file is loaded in the current
shell.  Also, you can look at dependencies like this:
