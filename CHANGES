** 01-16-98 RELEASE 2.13

- I've been waiting for the code to stabilize.  This release seems
very stable so I am releasing it.  The csh support still needs to be
brought up to date and better documentation is in the works.

- Phased out support for backward-compatible envy state environment
variables.


** 12-20-97 RELEASE 2.10

- Envys that set ETOP are treated specially.  Only one should be
loadable at the same time.

- Added support for 'echo' in envy files.

- Components are no longer removed from ENVY_PATH.

- Logging of all envious activity to $ETOP/var/envy.log.

- Improved organization of *.part2.

- Adding multiple components with += incorrectly occurred in the
reverse order.  Fixed.

- Adjusted dependency tracking to reduce false warnings.

- '.' is no longer added to the front of the PATH by default.


** 12-13-97 RELEASE 2.07

- Slightly better dependency tracking.  Avoids unloading ETOP during
'unload all'.

- envy load/unload now accept multiple targets on the command line

- More whitespace stricture in envy files.

- Slightly improved error messages.

- Factored 'wrapper' to use INITIAL_ENV.


** 11-24-97 RELEASE 2.06

- Initial public release.
