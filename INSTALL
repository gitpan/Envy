=head1 NAME

Envy - A comprehensive, multi-dimensional environment manager

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Installation takes a bit more work beyond simply typing 'make'.
Unfortunately, big returns generally require navigating big risks.
Sorry!

=head1 FIRST TIME USERS

It is recommended that you install envy privately in your home
directory before risking the disruption of thousands of grumpy
co-workers.  Before you proceed, print this documentation on paper so
you can refer to it if something electronic goes amiss.

To install envy, you need to know what is your login shell.  In the
Unix world, there are mainly two kinds of command line shells
available.  You can find out which one you have with:

  echo $SHELL

The following cover installation for both types of shells:

=over 4

=item * SH, KSH, BASH, Etc.

   PERL5PREFIX=$HOME/test; export PERL5PREFIX
   perl Makefile.PL
   make test
   make install

   # try it out
   $PERL5PREFIX/bin/wrapper -s echo

   mv $HOME/.profile $HOME/.profile.bak
   ln -s $PERL5PREFIX/etc/dot.profile $HOME/.profile

=item * CSH, TCSH, Etc.

   setenv PERL5PREFIX=$HOME/test
   perl Makefile.PL
   make test
   make install

   # try it out
   $PERL5PREFIX/bin/wrapper -s echo

   mv $HOME/.login $HOME/.login.bak
   ln -s $PERL5PREFIX/etc/dot.login $HOME/.login

=back

Be aware that C<bash> uses '.bash_profile' and C<zsh> uses
'.zprofile'.  You wont be able to test envy if you change the wrong
file, so don't.  Logout and login.  Hopefully, you will find that your
window manager did not restart.  This is a good sign.  Envy is now
installed in your home directory.

Type 'envy list' or 'envy help'.  Explore.  Get a feel for it.  Create
a few .env files.  Try out dimensions.  Maybe demo to your office-mate.

=head2 UNINSTALLING

Uninstalling is easy.  None of your old dot files have been deleted,
just renamed.  To see what has changed recently use:

  cd $HOME; ls -at | more

Simply undo the damage (rm the symlinks and copy your old dot files
back) and you should be back to normal.

=head2 WHY AM I GOING THROUGH THIS HELL?

Because envy could solve some of your long standing problems!

=over 4

=item * REUSE

Envy allows the centralization of configuration files.  When new
versions of software come out, it is easy to globally publish new
configuration files in preparation for a gradual and controlled
migration.  Instead of being locked into backward compatibility, you
can slowly nudge users into changing in the gentlest possible way.

=item * CHOICE

Each user can customize their environment to exactly the right degree.
Instead of being forced into a global environment or splintering into
an entirely custom environment, there is flexiblility to customize
within the globally standardized environment in varying degrees.

=item * DEPENDENCIES

Envy makes dependencies between packages explicit and understandable.

=item * CRON JOBS

Envy makes it easy to correctly set up cron jobs.

=head1 ENVY SETUP

Hopefully, you will find envy very easy to set up for your site.  If
there is any way it can be made easier, please let me know!

Before you install 'make test'; check ./Conf.pm; and 'make diff'.

=head2 SITE SETUP

Here is what happens upon login (Bourne Shell):

  $HOME/.profile -> $ETOP/etc/login/dot.profile
  envy load `cat $HOME/.custom/startup`
  $ETOP/etc/login/profile.part2
  $ETOP/etc/login/profile.site
  $HOME/.custom/profile
    $HOME/.shrc -> $ETOP/etc/login/dot.shrc
    $ETOP/etc/login/shrc.site
    $HOME/.custom/shrc
  $ETOP/etc/desktop/`cat $HOME/.custom/win.name`

You are free to customize the *.site files (or omit them).  You will
also need to set up window manager startup scripts under
$ETOP/etc/desktop.

=head2 CRONTAB

Use C<$ETOP/bin/wrapper> to initiate cron jobs.  C<wrapper> is a very
simple script that loads envys given on the command line then runs
scripts.

=head1 EXTENSION API

Envy is written entirely in perl and is designed to be used as a
library in addition to a command-line tool.  One possible project is a
graphical front end to help navigate the environment.  Also see the
TODO file.
